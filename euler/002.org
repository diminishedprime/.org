* Even Fibonacci numbers
*** Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def fibonacci-numbers
    ((fn fib [a b]
       (lazy-seq (cons a (fib b (+' a b)))))
     0 1))

  (->> fibonacci-numbers
       (take-while #(< % 4000000))
       (filter even?)
       (reduce +)) ;; => 4613732
