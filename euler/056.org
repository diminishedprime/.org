* Powerful digit sum
*** Problem 56
A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100
is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their
size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the
maximum digital sum?

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn digit-sum [n]
    (reduce + (map #(Integer/parseInt %) (map str (str n)))))

  (defn pow [a b]
    (.pow (BigInteger. (str a)) b))

  (->> (for [a (rest (range 100))
             b (rest (range 100))]
         (digit-sum (pow a b)))
       (apply max)) ;; => 972
