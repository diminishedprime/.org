* Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
*** Problem 45
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following
formulae:

Triangle    Tn=n(n+1)/2   1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal    Pn=n(3n−1)/2    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal   Hn=n(2n−1)    1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn pentagonal?
    [n]
    (let [calc (/ (inc (Math/sqrt (inc (* 24 n)))) 6)]
      (== calc (int calc))))

  (def hexagonal-n #(* % (dec (* % 2))))

  (def hexagonal-numbers
    (map  (rest (range))))

  (->> (rest (range))
       (map (partial + 143))
       (map hexagonal-n)
       (filter pentagonal?)
       first) ;; 1533776805
