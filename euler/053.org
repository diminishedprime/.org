* Combinatoric selections
*** Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.

In general,
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #           n!
  # nCr = ----------  where r ≤ n
  #        r!(n−r)!
#+END_SRC


It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of nCr, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater
than one-million?

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn n! [n]
    (reduce *' (rest (range (inc n)))))

  (def memoized-n! (memoize n!))

  (defn nCr [n r]
    (/ (memoized-n! n)
       (*' (memoized-n! r)
           (memoized-n! (- n r)))))

  (defn nCr-r-<=n [n]
    (map (partial nCr n) (range (inc n))))

  (->> (rest (range (inc 100)))
       (mapcat nCr-r-<=n)
       (filter #(> % 1000000))
       count) ;; => 4075
#+END_SRC
