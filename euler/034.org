* Digit factorials
*** Problem 34
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their
digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn slow-n! [n]
    (reduce * (range 1 (inc n))))

  (def n! (memoize slow-n!))

  (count (str (* 7 (n! 9)))) ;; This is a approximate upper bound.

  (defn digits-of [n]
    (map #(Integer/parseInt (str %)) (str n)))

  (defn has-property? [n]
    (= n
       (->> n
            digits-of
            (map n!)
            (reduce +))))

  (->> (range 3 (* 7 (n! 9)))
       (filter has-property?)
       (reduce +)) ;; => 40730
