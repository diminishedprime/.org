*** Why Do we program?
    1. Sheer joy of making things
    2. Making things that are useful to other people
    3. fascination of making complex puzzle-like objects an seeing them work
       together in subtle ways.
    4. Joy of always learning.
    5. Joy of working in a tractable medium.
*** But What sucks about it?
    1. You must perform perfectly
    2. (usually) other people set your direction
    3. Grand concepts are fun, but nitty-gritty details are usually not.
    4. Debugging has a linear convergence or worse, so it seems to drag on.
    5. Your product will /feel/ obsolete before completion due to a competitor
       touting the "next big thing"

*** Why is everything always late in software?
    1. We have poor techniques of estimating -- that assume thing things will go
       well.
    2. Our estimating techniques confuse effort with progress. This hides the
       assumption that people and months are interchangeable. (they're not)
    3. Since we're uncertain of our estimates, it's hard to be stubborn about
       saying "it's ready when it's ready"
    4. Progress is poorly measured.
    5. When things start to slip, the common response is to add more people to
       the project. This makes the problem worse since it's similar to dousing
       a fire with gasoline.

*** Conceptual Integrity
    "As the guidebook tells, this integrity was achieved by the self-abnegation
    of eight generations of builders, each of whom sacrificed some of his ideas
    so that the whole might be of pure design. The result proclaims not only the
    glory of God, but also His power to salvage fallen men from their pride."
    + Simply put, conceptual integrity can be achieved through an aristorcatic
      design process.
*** Concerns with Aristocracy in Development
    1. The specs will be too rich in function, and won't reflect practical
       considerations.
    2. The architects will get all the creative fun and the implementors will
       just be code monkeys
    3. The implementors won't have anything to do while they wait for the specs
       from the  architects.
*** Reponse to concerns
    1. See next chapter?
    2. Implementation is also a creative endeavor.
       + I'm not sure if I buy this as a good response to the concern, but it
         might have to do with what I view as architecture and implementor
         activities. If architecture really is doing mostly logical stuff, then
         there is a lot of creative work left for implementation, but I don't
         see that being the case very often. It seems like often architecture
         will also heavily involve physical design which limits what an
         implementor actually has domain over.
    3. This can be fixed with timing and phasing. First, some implementation can
       be done in parallel with the spec work. More importantly, you don't have
       to start a project with a bajillion implementors. You can pull them on
       once the work is actually ready to be done.
       + This seems to be more valid that the second concern, though once you
         have already hired the implementors, they will be sitting idly by. It
         does seem like this is one of the things that SAFe tries to address
         through getting features ready ahead of time. (Don't take that sentence
         as a personal endorsement of SAFe in any way)

*** Suggesting cheaper implementations
    + keep in mind that the builder has the incentive and responsibility for
      implementation. Architecture suggestions are not commands.
    + Have an implementation in mind for any design you suggest, but don't let
      this color what you think is right.
      + If you know what sucess means, /any/ implementation that hits that
        metric is right.
    + Make suggestions are improvements to implementation in private.
      + I feel like this helps to keep your position from unduely influencing
        direction. If improvements are made in a public forum, it is difficult
        for someone who is "under you" to speak up.
    + Forgo credit for suggested improvements
      + If an implementor comes up with a better implementation/design than what
        you have in mind, that is a good thing. Be prepared to praise this
        outcome, not fight it.

*** Org Chart Flexibility
    "Who: organization chart. This becomes intertwined with the interface
    specification, as Conway's Law predicts: "Organizations which design systems
    are constrained to produce systems which are copies of the communication
    structures of these organizations."[1] Conway goes on to point out that the
    organization chart will initially reflect the first system design, which is
    almost surely not the right one. If the system design is to be free to
    change, the organization must be prepared to change."

*** Plan The Organization for Change
    + Reluctance to document designs isn't due to time pressure, or lazsiness,
      it's due to the fact that it's asking someone to defend ideas that are (at
      best) tentative.
      + If you want people to be more willing to document designs, there needs
        to be understanding when something tentative is being documented. Not
        sure how this can actually happen, but the status quo leads to badly
        documented garbage.
