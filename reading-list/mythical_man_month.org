*** Why Do we program?
    1. Sheer joy of making things
    2. Making things that are useful to other people
    3. fascination of making complex puzzle-like objects an dseeing them work
       together in subtle ways.
    4. Joy of always learning.
    5. Joy of working in a tractable medium.
*** But What sucks about it?
    1. You must perform perfectly
    2. (usually) other people set your direction
    3. Grand concepts are fun, but nitty-gritty details are usually not.
    4. Debugging has a linear convergence or worse, so it seems to drag on.
    5. Your product will /feel/ obsolete before completion due to a competitior
       touting the "next big thing"
