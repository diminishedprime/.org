-- Exercise: Reading Comprehension

newtype Reader r a =
  Reader { runReader :: r -> a }

-- 1. Write liftA2 yourself. Think about it in terms of abstracting out the
-- difference between getDogR and getDogR' if that helps.
myLiftA2 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
myLiftA2 f a b = f <$> a <*> b

-- 2. Write the following function. Again, it is simpler than it looks.
asks :: (r -> a) -> Reader r a
asks f = Reader f

-- 3. Implement the Applicative for Reader.

-- To write the Applicative instance for Reader, we’ll use a pragma called
-- InstanceSigs. It’s an extension we need in order to assert a type for the
-- typeclass methods. You ordinarily cannot assert type signatures in instances.
-- The compiler already knows the type of the functions, so it’s not usually
-- necessary to assert the types in instances anyway. We did this for the sake
-- of clarity, to make the Reader type explicit in our signatures.

instance Functor (Reader r) where
  fmap f (Reader r) = Reader $ f . r

instance Applicative (Reader r) where
  pure :: a -> Reader r a
  pure a = Reader $ \r -> a

  (<*>) :: Reader r (a -> b)
        -> Reader r a
        -> Reader r b
  (Reader rab) <*> (Reader ra) = Reader $ \r -> rab r (ra r)

--Some instructions and hints.

-- a) When writing the pure function for Reader, remember that what you’re
-- trying to construct is a function that takes a value of type 𝑟, which you
-- know nothing about, and return a value of type 𝑎. Given that you’re not
-- really doing anything with 𝑟, there’s really only one thing you can do.

-- b) We got the definition of the apply function started for you, we’ll
-- describe what you need to do and you write the code. If you unpack the type
-- of Reader’s apply above, you get the following.

-- <*> :: (r -> a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)

-- contrast this with the type of fmap
-- fmap :: (a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)

--So what’s the difference? The difference is that with apply, unlike fmap, also
--takes an argument of type 𝑟.

--Make it so.

-- 4. Rewrite the above example that uses Dog and Person to use your Reader
-- datatype you just implemented the Applicative for. You’ll need to change the
-- types as well.

newtype HumanName = HumanName String deriving (Eq, Show)
newtype DogName = DogName String deriving (Eq, Show)
newtype Address = Address String deriving (Eq, Show)

data Person = Person { humanName :: HumanName , dogName :: DogName
                     , address :: Address
                     } deriving (Eq, Show)

data Dog = Dog { dogsName :: DogName
               , dogsAddress :: Address } deriving (Eq, Show)

getDogR :: Reader Person Dog
getDogR = Dog <$> Reader dogName <*> Reader address
