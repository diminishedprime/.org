%% Day 3 Self-Study

%% These exercises are relatively easy, but I did add some bonus questions to
%% stretch you a little bit.

%% Open Telecom Platform (OTP) is a powerful package with much of what youâ€™ll
%% need to build a distributed, concurrent service.

%% Find:

%% An OTP service that will restart a process if it dies

%% Documentation for building a simple OTP server

%% Do:

%% Monitor the translate_service and restart it should it die.

%% Make the Doctor process restart itself if it should die.

%% Make a monitor for the Doctor monitor. If either monitor dies, restart it.

%% The following bonus questions will take a little bit of research to complete:

%% Create a basic OTP server that logs messages to a file.

%% Make the translate_service work across a network.
