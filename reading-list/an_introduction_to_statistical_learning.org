           + (a) a more flexible method will fit the data closer and since there
             is a large sample size, there is less of a risk of over fitting the
             data.
           + (b) a less flexible method would be preferred since a flexible
             method would over fit the data due to the small number of
             observations.
           + (c) a flexible model would be better in this instance becasue an
             inflexible model will have trouble with non-linear models. It needs
             more degrees of freedom in order to get a small MSE.
           + (d) a more flexible model will be better here since more flexible
             models produce less bias. Since the MSE is the sum of bias and
             variance, and bias is lower with more degrees of freedom, a more
             flexible model will be better.
        2. [X]
           + (a) Regression. inference.
           + (b) Classification. prediction.
           + (c) Regression. prediction.
        3. [X]
           + (a) I sketched this on a piece of paper
           + (b)
             + Bias - as we move towards a more flexible model, bias decreses
               first sharply, then less sharply.
             + Variance - Depending on the model variance can either decrese
               with a more flexible model or increase. This depends on whether
               or not the true model is linear or not.
             + Training Error - more flexible models produce less training error
               since they tend to fit to the data well.
             + Test Error - more flexible models produce more test error since
               they tend to get fit to the training data.
             + Bayes error - Bayes error is sort of a "golden standard" of how
               good the MSE can be.
        4. [X]
           + (a)
             1. sorting fish by types as predicted by size and color. The
                response is the type of fish, and the predictors is size &
                color. For this, the goal is prediction.
             2. image to text classification. The response could be the correct
                letter, and the predictors could be the shape, width, and length
                of the letter stroke. The goal would be predicition
             3. signature verification. The response could be whether or not a
                document was signed by person X. The predictors could be the
                same as 2, but the goal in this case would probably be
                inference.
           + (b)
             1. predicting the length of a cat given parents measurements. The
                response is the length of the cat, and the predictors are the
                parents length. For this the goal could be either predicition or
                inference.
             2. mpg of a car. The reposne is the mpg, and the predictors could
                be number of cylnders, acceleration, top speed, etc. The goal in
                this case would be predicition.
             3. tuition for a university for a given future year. The response
                would be tuition, the predictors could be # of students &
                faculity salaries. This goal would be predicition.
           + (c)
             1. Detecting how a marketing campaign effects different markets.
             2. Detecting how a feature change in an app impacts different
                markets.
             3. Netflix movie recommendations. Recommend movies to groups that
                watch similiar movies .
        5. [X] A flexible approach to regression or classification can have less
           MSE in scenerios where the real model is verny non-linear. A less
           flexible approach tends to be simplier and can be useful for
           inferring how a change in one variable can impact another.
        6. [X] A parametric learning approach assumes a functional form. A
           non-parametric approach does not assume a functional form for f so it
           is more flexible in general ,but also requires a large number of
           observations.

              |   6 |  1 |  1 |  1 | sqrt(3)  | Red   |
           2. (b) green. Observarion 5 is the clossent neighbor for K=1.
           3. (c) red. Observatinos 32, 5 and 6 are the closest neighbors for K
              = 3. 2 Is Red, 5 is Green, and 6 is Red which gives us 2/3rds Red.
           4. (d) Small. A small K would be flixible for a non-linear decision
              boundary wheras a large K would try to fit a more linear boundary
              because it takes more points into consideration.

           + (f) Yes. weight horsepower and dispacement seem to all have a
             linear relationship with mpg. As each of these increse, mpg
             decreases.
        10. [X]
            + (a) 14 columns and 506 rows. The rows represent the number of
              observations and the columns represent the number of things
              measured or categorized for each observation.
            + (b) okay
            + (c) plot(Boston$age, Boston$crim) Areas with older homes tend to have more crime.
            + (d) Some have particilarly high crime rates. This can be viewed
              with hist(Boston$crim[Boston$crim>1], breaks=25)

            + (g) > t(subset(Boston, medv == min(Boston$medv))) &
              summary(Boston) With these two commands we can find which quartile
              each measurement is in and come to the conclusion that this place
              isn't awesome, but isn't terrible either.
            + (h) nrow(subset(Boston, rm > 7)) = 64. nrow(subset(Boston, rm >
              8)) = 18. These areas have a relatively lower crime rate comparing
              to the range, and a lower lstast also comparing to range.

        1. [X] The null hypotheses associated with table 3.4's p-values are that
           the advertising budgets of TV, radio, and newspaper do not have an
           effect on sales. Based on the very small p values for TV and radio,
           we can reject the null hypotheses for them. We cannot, however reject
           the null hypothesis for newspaper since it has a very small p value.
           We can conclude from this that the newspaper advertising budget does
           not affect sales.
        2. [X] KNN classifier method is (duh) used to solve classification
           problems, whereas the KNN regression method is used to solve
           regression problems. The KNN classifier aims to estimate the
           conditional probability that a measurement belongs to a specific
           class. KNN regression aims to solve regression problems (quantative)
           by identifiying the neighborhood, and then estimating f(x₀) as the
           average of all the training responses in the neighborhood.
        3. [X] The regression line ends up being:
           #+BEGIN_SRC text
             # Regression Line
             y = 50 + 20(GPA) + 0.07(IQ) + 35(Gender) + 0.01(GPA * IQ) - 10(GPA*Gender)

             # For Males
             y = 50 + 20(GPA) + 0.07(IQ) + 0.01(GPA * IQ)

             # For Females
             y = 85 + 10(GPA) + 0.07(IQ) + 0.01(GPA * IQ)
           #+END_SRC
           + [X] (a) iii.
           + [X] (b)
             #+BEGIN_SRC text
               y = 85 + 10(GPA) + 0.07(IQ) + 0.01(GPA * IQ)
               y = 85 + 10(4.0) + 0.07(110) + 0.01(4.0 * 110)
               y = 85 + 40 + 7.7 + 4.4
               y = 137.1
             #+END_SRC
           + [X] (c) False. The size of the cooeficiant isn't important. If we
             want to say that the interaction effect is not statistically
             signficiant we need to test the null hypothesis H₀: 𝛽₄ = 0 and look
             ath the p-value or the F statistic.
        4. [X]
           + [X] (a) Since the true relationship between x & y is linear, it's
             fair to expect that the least squars line would be close to the
             true regression line, so the RSS for the linear regression may be
             lower than for the cubic regression. however, if the test data has
             a small number of observations, or has many outliers, the cubic
             regression RSS may be lower. This is largely dependent on the
             actual data.
           + [X] (b) Again, it's hard to draw a hard conclusion without actually
             being able to see the data, but since the actual fit is linear, we
             wouldn't expect the training data to overfit the linear model. It
             is much more likely, however that the cubic regression would
             overfit to the training data. If this happens, it is likely that
             the cubic regression would have worse RSS.
           + [X] (c) If the relationship is not linear, the cubic model will fit
             better because it is a more flexible model.
           + [X] (d) There is not enough information to know.
        5. [ ] ???
        6. [X] with a bit of algebraic voodoo we can show that avg(y) will equal
