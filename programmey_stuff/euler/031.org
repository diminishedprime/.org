* Coin sums
*** Problem 31
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are
eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

*** Clojure
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def options [200 100 50 20 10 5 2 1])

  (defn change-options [amount options]
    (cond
      (= amount 0) 1
      (or (< amount 0)
          (not (seq options))) 0
      :else (+ (change-options amount
                               (rest options))
               (change-options (- amount (first options))
                               options))))

  (change-options 200 options) ;; => 73682
