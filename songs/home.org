The Dear Hunter
C                                                   F
  With the good chance that we crash, let's say our grace (our grace)
C                                            F
  In your final breath believe, you're not alone.



G
Help will come,
             F
Yeah you can come back home.
       G
'Cause help is on the way,
             F
Yeah you can come back home.
             C
So come back home

C                                            F
  As your eyes begin to fade, your mind will wander (will wander)
     C                                 Am
This life is just a game we play, that we can never win.
               F
But don't give up, no don't give up.

G
Help will come,
             F
Yeah you can come back home.
       G
'Cause help is on the way,
             F
Yeah you can come back home.
             C
So come back home

C                                            F
  Now in the end it's coming clear, you're not alone
       C                             Am
'Cause everyone you've ever loved is waiting here for you
              F                 G
So don't give up, no don't give up.

             G
Yeah, 'cause help will come,
                       F
Yeah you can come back home. (You can come back home yeah)
       G
'Cause help is on the way,
                         F
Yeah you can come back home. (You can come back home)
             C
So come back home
