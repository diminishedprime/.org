I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles
       F5                         C
in our eyes are mirror images and when
                G
we kiss they're perfectly aligned
    C              G
And I have to speculate that God himself
    F5                         C
did make us into corresponding shapes like
       G
puzzle pieces from the clay
C                       G
True it may seem like a stretch, but
                            F5
its thoughts like this that catch my troubled
                 C              G
head when you're away when I am missing you to death
C                             G
When you are out there on the road for
                 F5
several weeks of shows, and when you scan
        C             G
the radio I hope this song will guide you home

Chorus:
C                            G
They will see us waving from such great
                F5                C    G
heights, "come down now" they'll say
    C                             G
but everything looks perfect from far away,
       F5                    C    G
"come down now", but we'll stay

C                  G
I tried my best to leave this song on your
   F5                              C
machine but the persistent beat it sounded
     G
thin upon listening
C                     G
That frankly will not fly. you will hear
              F5
the shrillest highs and lowest lows with
       C                   G
the windows down when this is guiding you home

Chorus:
C                            G
They will see us waving from such great
                F5                C    G
heights, "come down now" they'll say
    C                             G
but everything looks perfect from far away,
       F5                    C    G
"come down now", but we'll stay
