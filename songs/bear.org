#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
Intro:
G  Bm  C  G F# Em  Am  C  D C#Maj11
Verse:
G  Bm  C  G(the root slide-down is G, F#)  Em  Am  C  D

          G               Bm
There's a bear inside your stomach
               C                  G F#
The cub's been kicking from within.
Em                        Am
He's loud, though without vocal chords
C                   D
We'll put an end to him

           G             Bm
We'll make all the right appointments
       C               G F#
No one ever has to know.
Em                          Am
And then tomorrow I'll turn 21
C                    D
We'll script another show

           G                  Bm
We'll play charades up in the Chelsea
      C                                  G F#
Drink champagne although you shouldn't be.
Em                      Am
We'll be blind and dumb until we fall asleep

            G            Bm
None of our friends will come
     C              G F#
They dodge our calls.
Em                        Am
And they have for quite a while now
           C
It's not a shock
                                            D
You don't seem to mind and I just can't see how.


Chorus:
          C     Bm
We're too old
          Am          D
We're not old, old at all
     C      Bm
Just too old
          Am          D
We're not old, old at all

Verse 2:
          G                Bm
There's a bear inside your stomach
               C                    G F#
The cub's been kicking you for weeks
Em                      Am
And if this isn't all a dream
                C            D
Well then we'll cut him from beneath

               G                Bm
Well we're not scared of making caves
           C                   G F#
Or finding food for him to eat
      Em               Am
We're terrified of one another
         C                 D
And terrified of what that means

               G          Bm
But we'll make only quick decisions
                C                          G F#
And you'll just keep my in the waiting room
            Em                    Am
And all the while I'll know we're fucked
        C                D
And not getting unfucked soon

            G                 Bm
When we get home we're bigger strangers
           C                G F#
than we've ever been before
           Em             Am          C               D
You sit in front of snowy television, suitcase on the floor
