  Intro:
  1  3-  4  1  6-  2-  4  5
  Verse:
  1  3-  4  1  6-  2-  4  5


  There's a bear inside your stomach
  The cub's been kicking from within.
  He's loud, though without vocal chords
  We'll put an end to him

  We'll make all the right appointments
  No one ever has to know.
  And then tomorrow I'll turn 21
  We'll script another show

  We'll play charades up in the Chelsea
  5rink champagne although you shouldn't be.
  We'll be blind and dumb until we fall asleep

  None of our friends will come
  They dodge our calls.
  And they have for quite a while now
  It's not a shock
  You don't seem to mind and I just can't see how.


  Chorus:
  We're too old
  We're not old, old at all
  Just too old
  We're not old, old at all

  Verse 2:
  There's a bear inside your stomach
  The cub's been kicking you for weeks
  And if this isn't all a dream
  Well then we'll cut him from beneath

  Well we're not scared of making caves
  Or finding food for him to eat
  We're terrified of one another
  And terrified of what that means

  But we'll make only quick decisions
  And you'll just keep my in the waiting room
  And all the while I'll know we're fucked
  And not getting unfucked soon

  When we get home we're bigger strangers
  than we've ever been before
  You sit in front of snowy television, suitcase on the floor
