capo 3

G                          D  D/C#
Let me pick through the empty dirt
        Bm       G             D    D/C#
And the rotten wood and the shoddy work
       Bm     G               D      D/C#      Bm     G            D     D/C#
Cause I'm interested, and our carpenter is so elegant at placing splinters
 Bm          G          e
Right beneath my nails,
D/C#          Bm            G
    where I cannot dig them out
D      D/C#     Bm      G        D     D/C#   Bm    G       D       D/C#
  But the same briars from your ribs are the tinder in my father's house

Bm     G
And I know,
D  D/C#  Bm G
   I know,
D  D/C#  Bm G
   I know,
D  D/C#  Bm G
   I know,
D  D/C#  Bm                 G
  I know myself better than anybody else
                 D  D/C# Bm G D D/C# Bm
And you're gonna run
G
You're gonna run
D  D/C#      Bm        G     D  D/C#
   When you find out who I am
Bm     G      D       D/C#    Bm     G         D         D/C#   Bm
I know I'm a pile of filthy wreckage you will wish you'd never touched
G
But you're gonna run
D  D/C#     Bm       G       D   D/C#  Bm
   When you find out who I am
    G                  D D/C# Bm
Yeah, you're gonna run
G
You're gonna run,
D    D/C#     Bm   G        D  D/C#  Bm
It's alright, everybody does
G
You're gonna run,
D    D/C#     Bm   G        D  D/C#  Bm
It's alright, everybody does
G
You're gonna run,
D    D/C#     Bm   G        D
It's alright, everybody does
