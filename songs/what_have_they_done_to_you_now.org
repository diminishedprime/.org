     C       Am        Gm

     C       Am        Gm


     C         Am              Gm
     If you're gonna fool around
     C             Am              Gm
     Why don't you keep it out of town
     C     Am      E          F
     Don't give me all the details
        C           F
     I don't wanna know
        C           Fm
     I don't wanna know
     C              Am           Gm
     What have they done to you now?


     C           Am                 Gm
     Guess you'd better keep your pants on
     C               Am              Gm
     There's no more tables left to dance on
     C  Am     E         F
     I used to carry you home
     C         F
     I don't anymore
     C        Fm
     Won't anymore
     C              Am           Gm
     What have they done to you now?


     C       Am        Gm

     Dm    G
     Old familiar
     Dm          G
     Friends to fill your
     C          F
     Heart with grief
         C   F
     And agony


     C       Am        Gm

     C       Am        Gm


     C        Am             Gm
     A little friendly conversation
     C      Am        Gm
     Character assassination
     C Am         E       F
     I just don't care anymore and
     C             F
     I don't wanna know
     C             Fm
     I don't wanna know
     C              Am          Gm
     What have they done to you now?


     C       Am        Gm

     C       Am        Gm
