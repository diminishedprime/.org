  C
  don't you worry, there my honey
  F
  we might not have any money
  Am                               F
  but we've got our love to pay the bills

  C
  maybe I think you're cute and funny,
  F                            Am
  maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you,
                     F
  if you know what I mean

       C                 E               F                     C
  Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                               E
  let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
      F                 G
  and teach them how to dance
  C                             E
  let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
  F                           D
  making everybody look like ants
  C                          F  G       C
  from way up there, you and I, you and I

       C
  well you might be a bit confused
      F
  and you might be a little bit bruised
      Am                            F
  but baby how we spoon like no one else
     C
  so I will help you read those books
      F
  if you will soothe my worried looks
      Am                              F
  and we will put the lonesome on the shelf


  C                      E               F                     C
  Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                               E
  let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
      F                 G
  and teach them how to dance
  C                             E
  let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
  F                           D
  making everybody look like ants
  C                          F  G       C
  from way up there, you and I, you and I


  oh, letâ€™s get rich and buy our parents homes in the south of France
  let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
  and teach them how to dance
  let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
  making everybody look like ants
  from way up there you and I, you and I, you and I
