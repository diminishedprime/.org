  I'm all spent like a crumpled dollar note
         F                   C
  in the hull of your old rowboat
            F                          C
  when it's tethered to the end of the dock
              G
  for a dozen years or so


  My clothes wore out

  all around the same time

  feel like I've been nickled and dimed
     F                      C
  so darling if you'd be so kind find a needle and a
  D                              G
  thread and help me mend what's mine

              F                          G
  cause I got holes in the bottoms of my shoes
   m    Em            Am
  from chasing after you
  F                   C
  pieces of them left behind
           D         G
  down the 27 state lines

  I'm all spent like the end of the season
  tired for all the right reasons
  the return on my exchange is much much more
  than you could even ever believe in

  I left little bits of my heart
  scattered out among the ozarks
  on the shores of many northern lakes
  and Louisiana in the dark

  cause I got holes in the bottoms of my shoes
  from chasing after you
  pieces of them left behind
  down the 27 state lines

  I swear I almost fell apart
  from using up the sum of my parts
  I'm all tired and I'm worn out
  from chasing you down so many towns
  but my dreams never seem to slow down

  cause I got holes in the bottoms of my shoes
  I'm tuckered out and bruised
  but I swear one day I will catch up with you
