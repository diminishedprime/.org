  Capo 1


  [Intro]

  C  Dm F  (C/E)
  C  Dm Em F (C/E)


  [Verse]

  C           Dm                          F            (C/E)
  So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
  C                    Dm         Em         F         (C/E)
  No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
  C                Dm  Em             F               (C/E)
  So deep in the swill with the most familiar of swine
        Dm          F      C
  For reasons wretched and divine

  C          Dm                    F               (C/E)
  She blows out of nowhere roman candle of the wild
  C           Dm      Em         F           (C/E)
  Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
  C            Dm        Em             F         (C/E)
  No other version of me I would rather be tonight
       Dm              F    C
  And lord she found me just in time


  [Pre-Chorus]

                 Am      Em            F
  Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
                 Dm                          Bb    Bm   C
  I need to be youthfully felt 'cause god I never felt young


  [Chorus]

  C         Dm                  F                                (C/E)
  She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
  C         Dm                    F                               (C/E)
  She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
  Am          Em              F                                 (C/E)
  We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
  C          Dm                       F
  We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues


  [Verse]

  C             Dm                         F               (C/E)
  Lord it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
  C           Dm  Em     F                           (C/E)
  Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
  C                Dm  Em              F                 (C/E)
  Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
  Dm                 F        C
  Sit back and watch the world go by


  [Pre-Chorus]

        Am   Em              F
  Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
  Dm                               Bb    Bm  C
  We tried the world good god it wasn't for us


  [Chorus]

  C         Dm                  F                                (C/E)
  She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
  C         Dm                    F                               (C/E)
  She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
  Am          Em              F                                 (C/E)
  We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
  C          Dm                       F
  We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues


  [Instrumental]

  Am   Em-F   Em-F   Em  C
  Am   Em-F   Em-F   Em  C
  Am   Em-F   Em-F   Em  C
  Dm   Bb Bm C


  [Verse]

  C            Dm                      F               (C/E)
  Cut clean from the dream that night let my mind reset
  C               Dm                   F           (C/E)
  Lookin' up from a cigarette and she's already left
  C                     Dm   Em                 F                          (C/E)
  I start diggin' up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
  Dm                      F  C
  For whatever poor soul is coming next


  [Chorus]

  C         Dm                  F                                (C/E)
  She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
  C         Dm                    F                               (C/E)
  She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
  Am          Em              F                                 (C/E)
  We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
  C          Dm                       F
  We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues
