Intro:
C, Em, C, Em, Am7, Am, G, F


Verse:

C                          Em

Even if you never strayed from me

C                         Em

I'd question your fidelity

F                            Dm              G

There'd always be a shroud of suspicion

F                         Dm     G

And my hearts a liability

C                                          Em

With your hands marooned so freshly red

C                            Em

You'd wrap your lips around my neck

F                                    Dm              G

Try and forced to love the thought of me

F                                   G

Simple motions make me ill


Chorus:

Am                             C

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned

         Em                                       G

On an under covered mattress did it feel so good hope it felt so good

Am                                             C

Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me

                  Dm                           Em

Its so much better, their all much better

F                                                             G

Take off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work


BAHHH BAHHHH's:

C, G.

(you can get the rhythm)


Verse: Same Pattern as last verse.

Maybe this is just a work of art

Scripted players in a play of lust

Hope the endings well worth waiting for

And everything you wished it be


Chorus: Same Pattern as last Chorus.

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned

On an under covered mattress did it feel so good hope it felt so good

Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me

Its so much better, you're all much better

Take off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work


BAHHHH BAHHHH's: Same




Bridge:

C        Em                     G

Oh my god what have I done

C                                 G                   Em

Now my darling put your clothes back on

C         Em                   G

Oh my god what have I done

C                                 G                   Em

Now my darling put your clothes back on


Red Hands:

                F

Cause you cant be caught red handed

               C            Em

If you're not red handed

         F                                  C             Em

My darling if I ever said those words to you

               F                                      C                  Em

I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve

            F                               C            Em

A display for you to see Im on display


Repeat through end.

End on C
