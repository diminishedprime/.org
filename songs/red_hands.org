Usually in C
Intro:
1, 3-, 1, 3-, 6-7, 6-, 5, 4


Verse:

Even if you never strayed from me
I'd question your fidelity
There'd always be a shroud of suspicion
And my hearts a liability
With your hands marooned so freshly red
You'd wrap your lips around my neck
Try and forced to love the thought of me
Simple motions make me ill

Chorus:
6-                             1
Was it bitter when you tossed and turned
         3-                                       5
On an under covered mattress did it feel so good hope it felt so good
6-                                 1
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me
            2-                     3-
Its so much better, their all much better
              4                           5                1
Take off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work

BAHHH BAHHHH's:
1, 5.

Maybe this is just a work of art
Scripted players in a play of lust
Hope the endings well worth waiting for
And everything you wished it be

Chorus: Same Pattern as last Chorus.

Was it bitter when you tossed and turned
On an under covered mattress did it feel so good hope it felt so good
Don't know what I'd do if you lost sleep over little old me
Its so much better, you're all much better
Take off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work

BAHHHH BAHHHH's: Same
