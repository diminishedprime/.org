  C         E       Am       F
  wiping my eyes of sleep
  drinking yesterday morning's coffee
  slam my head against the wall
  put the same black jeans on
  wear a hat so you can't see my hair

  G                      F
  maybe I won't die this time
  maybe I'll be fine this time

                             C
  maybe i'm my own greatest fear
                           Em
  maybe i'm too scared to admit that
                              F
  i might not be as dark as i think
                    Dm
  maybe i'm not the person
                         C
  that i never wanted to be
  maybe i'm my own greatest fear
  maybe i'm too scared to admit that
  i might not be as dark as i think
  i might not be as dark as i think

  so here's the thing, i'm doing fine
  i know that i'm not worth your time
  you need a change, i'm still the same
  took everything but my name

  maybe i won't die this time
  maybe i'll be fine this time
  maybe i'm my own greatest fear
  maybe i'm too scared to admit that
  i might not be as dark as i think
  maybe i'm not the person
  that i never wanted to be
  maybe i'm my own greatest fear
  maybe i'm too scared to admit that
  i might not be as dark as i think
  i might not be as dark as i think
