     [Intro 1]
     F#  A  E  D  (x2)

     [Verse]
     F#                          A
     Language is scary when over-analysed,
     E                           D
     Every word that I say seems far too contrived.
     F#                             A
     What are your intentions? I’m ashamed by mine.
              E                      D
     When I'm thinking too much I realise I'm unkind.
        F#                       A
     Pretend that I’m nicer than I’ll ever be,
         E                          D
     I'm selfish and deluded, enjoy my hypocrisy.
        F#                               A
     Complain that I’m bored, when being bored is a privilege.
     E                                  D
     Act like I’m suffering, there’s no suffering in this.
     F#                         A
     First world problems, they breed in my head.
         E                             D
     Ethical contradictions between my actions and what I’ve said.
              F#                       A
     I should just shut my mouth as evidence piles against me,
              E                             D
     that I’m so much worse than I think, exposed as a phoney.
     F#         A
     I am shit, I am shit
     E                   D
     nurr-nurr nurr-nurr fucking dick.
     F#         A
     I am shit, I am shit
     E                    D    D
     nurr-nurr nurr-nurr  nurr-nurr
