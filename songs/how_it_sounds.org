* Ghost Mice
** How It Sounds
#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  F C G Am x fiveEVer

  Everyone's hoping you can hold off the attack
  They keep telling you that you should just relax
  But if they knew how that sounded to you
  They would know that it's something you can't do

  Everybody's telling you everything's gonna be OK
  They keep saying tomorrow's another day
  But if they knew how that sounded to you
  They would know why you know that that's not true
  They would know why you know that that's not true

  Everyone's saying it's not as bad as it seems
  They keep talking but you don't know what they mean
  And if they knew how that sounded to you
  They'd be alone at home and locked inside their rooms

  Everyone's telling you the reasons you should live
  They keep saying that you got so much to give
  But if they knew how that sounded to you
  It would break their hearts in two
  It would break their hearts in two

  But they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
  So they'll keep talking and wasting their breath
  They don't know how to save your sorry soul
  So they'll keep talking till there's no words left
  They'll keep talking till there's no words left
