* What It Means to Be Alone
** The Dear Hunter

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
Capo 1


E            F#m
Oh, you were born with the sun

    E            F#m
And oh, you will die with the moon

    E                                  F#m
And everything you thought you had you lost

    E                                   F#m
But now you'd never lose what you don't have


*Pre-Chorus*

A           B            E        G#     A
Prayers from above, never answered quite enough

        F#m           Am     E
Now the only one you have is you


*Chorus*

E         Bm
With this cruel and bitter heart

         A
You were cold and in love

          G
Left here naked in the sun

E                    Bm
Run scared from this cruel and bitter world

         A                G
This has only begun as the bombs are busting off


*Verse*

Am            Em
Smoke arose on azimuth glares

Am                Em           D
Bodies brewed and frigid winter air

      Am                Em     D            C
Where families son's are robbed beneath their feet

    Em     D       Am          Em    D
And hearts concede "Ab Ovo," the angel sings "Ad astra"

    Em          D      Am
Our eyes to the sea, we thought that we had

  Em        D             Em
A cause for suffering, and reason not to die alone

D
Oh but


*Repeat Chorus*

Em                            Am
With our feet beneath us, and our hands to the sky

   C                        A#        A#     A#/C
We extend our limbs begging "why, oh, why?"

           Am    Em    Am   Em  D
Don't turn away


G   C   Em  D  C  C/B


*Repeat Pre-Chorus*

A           B           E        G#     A
Prayers from above never answered quite enough

F#m      B         E       G#       A
Looking up, never offered you too much

        F#m           Am
Now the only one you have is...
