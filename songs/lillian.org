Verse:

Em      D        Am       B(bass)
She was stuck in pictures,
Em              D       Am   B(bass)
While he passed time in film.
Em       D                Am    B(bass)
Oh silly fame, why do you play?
Em       D             Am   B(bass)
Frame by frame, day by day.
     Em    D        Am    B(bass)
With reels changing over,
    Em       D      Am    B(bass)
And dropping to the sides.
Em         D                   Am   B(bass)
Oh, solemn soul, see where you are.
    Em          D                  Am    B(bass)
And look to the sides, what you discard.


Chorus:
           C
Press your lips to mine,
D#dim      Em       C
Breathe in deep and lie.
         Am      B
When the cameras roll,
      Em  D    A
Hide away your soul.
           Am            B
Flash your eyes, forge a smile.

Post-Chorus:

     G       B         G       B
Entertain but don’t get stuck in something you
Em
hate.

Pre-Verse:
This part is difficult to play on guitar correctly so here's the notes to the chord:

Right Hand: F#-G-B
Left Hand: switches between G(bass) and D(bass)


Verse 2:

Em
Bring me the eyes of the earth,
                          Am
Cut off the tongue of the world.
         Em           Am
Keep the ends close inside,
       Em           Am
To the means that imply.
        B                           Em
And not living the life that you’re worth.


Chorus:
              C
Pressing your lips to mine,
D#dim      Em       C
Breathe in deep and lie.
         Am      B
When the cameras roll,
      Em       E
Hide away your soul.
              C
Flashing your eyes to sell,
D#dim Em     C
Lying to yourself.
        Am             B
Dodging truth from the start,
      Em  D    A
Hide away your heart.
      Am             B
Turn around, forge a smile.


     G       B         G       B         G
Entertain but don’t get stuck in something painful,
B         G         B
Something worse than nothing.


Bridge:

   Am
We could have been smart,
         C
With the plot from the start.
   D#dim
Mistakes from the spark,
   B              C
We knew it wasn’t love.


Chorus:

D#dim      Em       C
Breathe in deep and lie.
         Am      B
When the cameras roll,
      Em  D    A
Hide away your soul.
           Am            B
Flash your eyes, forge a smile.
     Em
Entertain.


Repeat Post Chorus
