** It's Cool
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     I don’t want to be right, I want to be happy
     I don’t want to be sad, I wanna be sappy
     I wanna cry to romantic comedies
     I want to watch stupid action movies

     And if there is a god upstairs, well I bet he likes us
     Cause we’re good, we’re good, it’s cool, it’s cool
     I say to myself as I stuff my face with food
     Stuff my face with food
     Stuff my face with food

     And there is always so much conflict, I don’t get it
     I guess I just don’t really hate everything as much as you do, I’m sorry dude
     You’re consumed with getting the last word and proving yourself true
     That’s not happiness, that’s just pleasure, please don’t confuse the two
     Don’t confuse the two
     Please don’t confuse the two
     Please don't confuse the two
