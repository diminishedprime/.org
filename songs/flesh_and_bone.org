Keaton Henson-Flesh and Bone
 Capo 2
      Em
I am alone, so don't speak
        C
I find war, and I find peace
           G                  D/F#
I find no heat, no love in me
         Em
And I am low and unwell
        C
This is love, this is hell
           G                      D/F#
This sweet plague that follows me

       C      G
And my body's weak
        D/F#              Em
Feel my heart giving up on me
      C           G           D/F#
I'm worried it might just be
       C       G
And my body's weak
        D/F#               Em
Feel my lungs giving up on me
       C         G           D/F#
I'm worried it might just be
                 Em       C      G
something my soul needs


And I see a war on the screen,
And it is is cruel and unclean
But I still worry more about you

And I am rude and unkind
Have no thought, and have no time
Have no eyes, so no point of view

And my body's weak,
I feel my heart giving up on me,
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak,
feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
something my soul needs

 Am
                         C
And I am more than this frame,
                        G
I feel hurt and I feel shame
                               D/F#
I just wish you would feel the same

And I am more than these bones
I feel love, I feel alone
I just wish you would come home



My body's weak
I feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak,
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
something my soul needs
Em            C        G
is you, lying next to me.
         Em         C      G
and it's you, lying next to me.
