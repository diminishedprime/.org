#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  C                      G           Am
  Maybe I need some rehab, or maybe just need some sleep
  Em         F              Em            F
  I've got a sick obsession, I'm seeing it in my dreams
  C                           G         Am
  I'm looking down every alley, I'm making those desperate calls
  Em            F                Em           F
  Im staying up all night hoping, Hit my head against the walls

  C                    G      Am
  What you've got boy is hard to find
  Em      F                     Em       F
  I Think about it all about it, all the time
  C                G          Am
  I'm all strung up, my heart is fried
  Em          F       Em
  I just cant get you off my mind

  F            C                          G      Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                             F
  Your love your love your love
  C                                       G      Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F           Em       F
  Your love your love your love

  C                         G                 Am
  Won't listen to any advice, mamma's telling me i should think twice
  Em             F           Em               F
  But left to my own devices, i'm addicted its a crisis!
  C                               G                     Am
  My friends think I've gone crazy, my judgment is getting kinda hazy
  Em          F                  Em
  My sneeze is gonna be affected, if I keep it up like a love sick crackhead

  C                    G      Am
  What you've got boy is hard to find
  Em      F                     Em       F
  I Think about it all about it, all the time
  C                G          Am
  I'm all strung up, my heart is fried
  Em          F       Em
  I just cant get you off my mind

  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F          Em       F
  Your love your love your love
  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F           Em       F
  Your love your love your love

  F                 G
  I don't care what people say
  Am
  The rush is worth the price I pay
  F                        G
  I get so high when you're with me
  Am
  But crash and crave you when you when you leave
  F                   G
  So I got a question; Do you want to have a slumber party in my basement?
  Am
  Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum? Is my love, your drug?
  F                G               Am
  (huh) Your drug? (huh) your drug? (huh) your drug?
  Is my love, your drug?

  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F          Em       F
  Your love your love your love
  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F           Em       F
  Your love your love your love

  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F          Em       F
  Your love your love your love
  C                           G         Am
  Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
  Em                 F           Em       F
  Your love your love your love
