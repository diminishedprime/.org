  And there you have it, hope you like it!

  I backed my car into a cop car the other day
  Well he just drove off sometimes life's OK
  I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did I say
  Well you just laughed it off it was all OK

  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on any way

  Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
  It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand
  Bad news comes don't you worry even when it lands
  Good news will work its way to all them plans
  We both got fired on exactly the same day
  Well we'll float on good news is on the way

  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on OK
  And we'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on
  Now don't you worry we'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on alright
  Don't worry we'll all float on

  (alright already)
  And we'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on alright
  Don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
  We'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on OK
  Don't worry we'll all float on
  Even if things get heavy we'll all float on alright
  Already we'll all float on alright
  Don't you worry we'll all float on alright
  All float on
