** Alone In The Light
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     I am a tree
     Blossoming with apologies
     And sometimes I can't breathe
     Into the wind against my face

     I am afraid
     Of the attention that I'm paid
     And sometimes I can't sing
     Although I'm sitting on your stage

     It's a travesty
     You won't sing with me
     Because I'm all alone
     Alone in the light

     It's a travesty
     You won't sing with me
     Because I'm all alone
     Alone in the light

     I am a fraud
     All alone with my God
     Though I pray and I pray
     I've got nothing to say

     Though I pray and I pray
     I've got nothing to say

     It's a travesty
     You won't sing with me
     Because I'm all alone
     Alone in the light

     It's a travesty
     You won't sing with me
     Because I'm all alone
     Alone in the light
