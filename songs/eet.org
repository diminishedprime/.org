Capo 1
           Am       G          C               F
It’s like forgetting the words to your favorite song 
         Am        G
You can’t believe it 
          C              F
You were always singing along 
         Am     G        C        F
It was so easy and the words so sweet 
        Am       G
You can’t remember 
            C          F
You try to feel the beat  

F       C    G
Eeeeeeeeeee, eet, eet, eet 
F       C    G
Eeeeeeeeeee, eet, eet, eet 

You spent half of your life trying to fall behind 
You’re using your headphones to drown out your mind 
It was so easy, and the words so sweet 
You can’t remember 
You try to move your feet 

Eeeeeeeeeee, eet, eet, eet 
Eeeeeeeeeee, eet, eet, eet 

Someone’s deciding whether or not to steal 
He opens the window just to feel the chill 
He hears that outside a small boy just starting to cry 
‘Cause it’s his turn but his brother won’t let him try  

It’s like forgetting the words to your favorite song 
You can’t believe it 
You were always singing along 
It was so easy and the words so sweet 
You can’t remember 
You try to feel the beat
