#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  Original - Capo 7

  Am   C   D   G
  Em   D   C   D

  Am                 C      D          G
  Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
  Em                    D           C        D
  You’re not the one to talk things through
  Am                           C       D      G
  You checked your texts while I masturbated
  Em          D       C     D
  Manelich, I feel so used

  Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
  You’re not the one to talk things through
  You checked your texts while I masturbated
  [mon uh lick]
  Manelich, I feel so used

  Found myself on Spencer’s Butte
  Traced your shadow with my shoe
  Empty outline changed my view
  Now all of me thinks less of you

  On the sheet I see your horizon
  All of me pressed onto you
  But in this light you look like Poseidon
  I’m just a ghost you walk right through

  Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte
  Landscape changed my point of view
  Revelation may come true
  Now all of me thinks less of you
