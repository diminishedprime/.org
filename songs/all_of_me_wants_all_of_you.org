  Capo 7

  Am   C   D   G   Em   D   C   D

  Am                 C      D          G
  Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
  Em                    D           C        D
  You’re not the one to talk things through
  Am                           C       D      G
  You checked your texts while I masturbated
  Em          D       C     D
  Manelich, I feel so used


  Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
  You’re not the one to talk things through
  You checked your texts while I masturbated
  Manelich, I feel so used

  Found myself on Spencer’s Butte
  Traced your shadow with my shoe
  Empty outline changed my view
  Now all of me thinks less of you

  On the sheet I see your horizon
  All of me pressed onto you
  But in this light you look like Poseidon
  I’m just a ghost you walk right through

  Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte (All of me wants all of you)
  Landscape changed my point of view (All of me wants all of you)
  Revelation may come true (All of me wants all of you)
  Now all of me thinks less of you (All of me wants all of you)

  (All of me wants all of you)
