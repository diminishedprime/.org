* Lake Street Dive
** Sometimes When I am Drunk (and you are wearing my favorite shirt)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  you're so generous with
  time and money I
  almost I wish I loved you instead of him

  you're so friendly and
  call so often I
  almost wish I loved you stead of your friend

  I tried to rule my heart with
  improved loving conditions
  but it seems firmly grounded
  and refuses to listen

  Sometimes when I am drunk and you are
  wearing my favorite shirt
  I can't convince my self, my head's my heart

  You're my drunken angel
  and I'm yours too
  but I know once I'm sober I'll be over you
  again

  Instrumental

  Call me a slut
  call me all the time and
  I can't answer without saying goodbye

  build me up, build me
  into something that
  I can only achieve when you are high

  I tried to appease you and answer all your questions,
  but you don't ask what you don't know and that's where we get lost

  Sometimes when I am drunk and you are
  wearing my favorite shirt
  I can't convince my self my head's my heart

  You're my drunken angel
  and I'm yours too
  but I know once I'm sober I'll be over you
  again

  Longer Instrumental

  Sometimes when I am drunk and you are
  wearing my favorite shirt
  I can't convince my self my head's my heart

  You're my drunken angel
  and I'm yours too
  but I know once I'm sober I'll be over you
  but I know once I'm sober I'll be over you
  <indistinct note sounds>

  hopeless relapse you
  can't have me back
  I've moved on don't ask me why
