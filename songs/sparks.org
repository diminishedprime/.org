Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You'll say, "oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do
I say oh
I say oh
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah I will, yes I will
I said oh
I cry oh
Yeah I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out
La, la, la, la, oh...
