  Intro
  C Am7 Gsus4/E C x2

  Please pick me up on my long walk back home
  Give me something to eat, for I’m weak to my bones,
          Am            Em            F           C
  Hold me tight in your arms, give me glimmers of hope
         Am        Em     F      G
  Do not love me though
  Do not love me though
  Do not love me though

  Let me lay in your bed, talk of things you don’t know
  Take the clothes from my back, and make love to me slow
  and you’re free to think of all you feel and let go

  Do not tell me though
  Do not tell me though
  Do not tell me though

  Introduce me to friends, make excuses for me
  I will tug on your coat when I’m ready to leave
  Please don’t let me stop you from thinking you are free

  Don’t fall for me
  Don’t fall for me
  Do not fall for me

  And when I get tired and eventually leave
  I’ll get back on the road and I’ll leave you in peace.
  And I won’t even look back as the tears hit your cheek

  Please don’t look at me
  Do not look at me
  Don’t look at me
