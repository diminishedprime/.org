  Verse 1:
  Here we go  welcome to my funeral
  without you i don't even have a pulse

  Verse 2:
  When did I become such a hypocrite
  double life lies that you caught me in
  trust me I'm paying for it
  with every move i die

  On the floor I'm just a zombie
  who I am is not who I wanna be
  I'm such a tragedy
  with every move i die

  I have destroyed our life
  It's gone payback is sick
  it's all my fault

  I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
  Just fighting To get through the night

  I'm losing it
  With every move I die

  Whoa This is it and now
  your really gone this time
  never once thought
  I'd be in pieces left behind

  I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
  Just fighting To get through the night
  I'm losing it
  With every move I die
  I'm faded I'm broken inside
  I've wasted the love of my life
  I'm losing it
  With every move I die
