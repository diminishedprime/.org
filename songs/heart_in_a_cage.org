  Intro: Em G Em G Em G Em G Em



  Verse 1:

  Em                                C        G
  Well I don't feel better when I'm fucking around
  Em                                C            G
  And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground, so don't
  Em                           C            G
  Teach me a lesson cause I've already learned
  Em                                  C             G
  Yeah the sun will be shining and my children will burn

         Em    C              G
  Oh the heart beats in its cage


  Verse 2:

  Em                                C              G
  I don't want what you want I don't feel what you feel
         Em                        C         G
  See I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
             Em                      C           G
  Yeah I got left, left, left, left, left, left, left,
           Em                              C       G
  Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone

         Em    C              G
  Oh the heart beats in its cage


  Bridge:

  Em              A                   D        C#
  All our friends, they're laughing at us
  Em                A           D       C#
  All the ones you love you mistrust
  Em         A            D          C#
  Help me I'm not quite myself
  Em             A      D           C#
  Look around there's no one else left


  Verse 3:

  Em                         C                  G
  I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
         Em                      C                 G
  Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
           Em                      C           G
  Oh I get left, left, left, left, left, left, left
          Em                              C          G
  And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire

         Em    C              G
  Oh the heart beats in its cage
          Em    C              G
  Yes the heart beats in its cage......
