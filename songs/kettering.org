  Intro:
  Am Am(add9) C Em Em7 Am x2

  I wish that I had known in that first
  Minute we met the unpayable  debt
  That I owed you

  'Cause you'd been abused by the
  Bone that refused you and you hired me
  To make up for that

  And walking in that room when you had
  Tubes in your arms those singing morphine alarms
  Out of tune

  They had you sleeping and eating and I
  Didn't believe them when they called you a hurricane
  Thunderclap

  When I was checking vitals I
  Suggested a smile you didn't talk for a while
  You were freezing

  You said you hated my tone it made you
  Feel so alone so you told me I had
  To be leaving

  But something kept me standing by that
  Hospital bed I should have quit but instead
  I took care of you

  You made me sleep and uneven and I
  Didn't believe them when they told me that there
  Was no saving you

  Outro:
  Am Am(add9) C Em Em7 Am (repeat/fade to finish)
