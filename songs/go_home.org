  G                Am
  I went walking again
                  Em                        C                     G
  I'll go out and forget to tell any of my friends where I'm going
  G                          Am                 Em
  I'm just drunk on the side of the road in a ditch when you find me â€“
          C
  I wanna go home, but I'm sick
  G                            Am        Em          C
  There's more whiskey than blood in my veins
   Em
  More tar than air in my lungs
         C
  The strung out call I make
  G                         G#
  Burned down on the edge of the highway
   Em                                     C
  "I'm sorry for asking, but please, come take me home"

  G  Am  Em    C

  G
  I quit talking again
  Am                        Em                  C
  But I know you're still listening to see if I sleep or I pierce my skin
  G                     Am
  Needles to the worn out rags
  Em                        C
  The folds in my arms, the sickening black
  G                     Am
  And I haven't been taking my meds
  Em                        C
  Lock all the cabinets, send me to bed
                  G                     Am
  Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared
  Em                                          C
  Cause I'm alone again and I don't like the things I see

  G                     Am
  And I haven't been taking my meds
  Em                        C
  Lock all the cabinets, send me to bed
                  G                     Am
  Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared again
  Em                                          C
  And make my insides clean with your kitchen bleach
  G                            Am                Em                                          C
  But I've kissed enough bathroom sinks to make up for the lovers that never loved me
  G                           Am
  And I know my body is just dirty clothes;
   Em                          C
  I'm tired of washing my hands
                 G
  God, I wanna go home
