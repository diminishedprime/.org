  Intro: C   G/B  Am  C/G  F  C/E  F  G

  C           G/B     Am        C/G
  The summer days are gone too soon
   F            C/E     F         G
  You shoot the moon, miss completely
  C           G/B     Am        C/G
  And now you've left to face the gloom,
  F          C/E        F             G
  The empty room, that once smelled sweetly
   Am          G         Am/F#       F
  Of all the flowers you plucked if finally
   C    G/B     Am  G/B
  you knew the reason.
  Am       G     Am/F#    F
  Why you had to each be lonely.
  C       G/B     C   G
  Was it just the season.


  C       G/B     Am    C/G
  Now the fall is here again
  F            C/E     F         G
  You can't begin to give in, it's all over.
  C         G/B        Am       C/G
  When the snows come rolling through
  F              C/E  F             G
  you've rolling too with some new lover.
  Am          G      Am/F#       F
  Will you think of times you've told me
       C    G/B     Am  G/B
  That you knew the reason
  Am      G     Am/F#    F
  Why we had to each be lonely.
  C       G/B     C   G
  Was it just the season.


  C   G/B  Am  C/G  F  C/E  F  G  X 2


  Am          G      Am/F#       F
  Will you think of times you've told me
       C    G/B     Am  G/B
  That you knew the reason
  Am      G     Am/F#    F
  Why we had to each be lonely.
  C       G/B     C   G
  Was it just the season.
