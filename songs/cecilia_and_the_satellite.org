  Verse: F then C forever

  I've locked myself in a hotel room
  Then waited all night for the walls to move
  I've loved some girls that I barely knew
  I've made some friends, and I've lost some too
  Crashed my car, I was seventeen
  My mother in the seat riding next to me
  The things I've learned from a broken mirror
  How a face can change when a heart knows fear

  Dm
  For all the things my eyes have seen,
  F
  The best by far is you

              C                Am
  If I could fly, then I would know
                  F                            C
  What life looks like from up above and down below
                G                 Am
  I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
               F                          C
  Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite

  And you're the sky

  F C G Am
  Oh, Oh

  I've caf√© crawled through Amsterdam
  Been around the world with a punk rock band
  And I've seen London, and I've played Japan
  I've been knocked down, I got up again

  For all the places I have been,
  I'm no place without you

  Chorus

  F, C, G, Am
  Oh, Oh
  I'm the satellite
  And you're the sky

  F, C

  Dm
  For all the things my hands have held,
  F
  The best by far is you

  Chorus

  Outro: F, C, G, Am
  And you're the sky
  And you're the sky
  I'm the satellite
  And you're the sky
  And you're the sky

  F, C until end of song
