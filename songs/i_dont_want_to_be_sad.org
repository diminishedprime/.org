** I Don't Want To Be Sad
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     Am, G, F, (C, G, Am)
     Im always so lonely, frustrated and angry
     And I never know if its my fault
     Or if its just my brain working fucking wrong

     I have got problems that I cannot withhold
     Cause I have got diseases that I cannot control

     G, F, C, G
     My feelings are at the mercy of my chemical imbalances
     Im trapped inside the torture of living with bipolar disorder

     Ill always hate myself more than I hate anyone else
     Ill always hate myself more than I hate anyone else
     Cause I know that I have earned it
     From years and years of treating myself like shit

     Am, G, (C, G, Am)
     And I want to believe that its not my fault
     Am, G, (C, G, F)
     And I want to believe I can live a fulfilling life
     G
     But I might not
     C
     I might not
