  The Things that Hide Away
  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  Waking up I felt that hesitation
  Like I wasn't meant to wake up at all
  Letting out a soft, cynical sigh
  My god, it's just the answer
  To the question I can't find

  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  Marching on it's one foot then the other
  Better than one foot then none at all
  Biting off way more than I can chew
  Like I sometimes do
  I never know just when and where to start

  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Maybe we're just never meant to know why
  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Why, why, why?

  Oohs
  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Maybe we're just never meant to know why
  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Why, why, why?

  Oohs

  C - Em - G - Am - G
