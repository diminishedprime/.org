  The Things that Hide Away
  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  C                        F
  Waking up I felt that hesitation
         G                          Em
  Like I wasn't meant to wake up at all
  F                           C
  Letting out a soft, cynical sigh
                        G
  My god, it's just the answer
                          C
  To the question I can't find

  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  Marching on it's one foot then the other
  Better than one foot then none at all
  Biting off way more than I can chew
  Like I sometimes do
                    Am       Am/G     D/F#    G
  I never know just when and where to start

  F
  Why are we here?
            G
  Why do we die?
  Em                                 E
  Maybe we're just never meant to know why
  F
  Why are we here?
            G
  Why do we die?
            C
  Why, why, why?

  Oohs
  C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Maybe we're just never meant to know why
  Why are we here?
  Why do we die?
  Why, why, why?

  Oohs

  C - Em - G - Am - G
