The Things that Hide Away
C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7


C                          C1
Waking up I felt that hesitation
G1                                   Em
Like I wasn't meant to wake up at all
C1                              C
Letting out a soft, cynical sigh
                        G1
My god, it's just the answer
                            C
To the question I can't find

C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7

C                                  C1
Marching on it's one foot then the other
G1                                   Em
Better than one foot then none at all
C1                                 C
Biting off way more than I can chew
                  G1
Like I sometimes do
                  Am7      G/Am7      F#/D    G
I never know just when and where to start

F1
Why are we here?
             G1
Why do we die?
C                 B/E               E
Maybe we're just never meant to know why
F1
Why are we here?
              G
Why do we die?
Why, why, why?

Oohs
C - Em - G - Am7 - G/Am7


F1
Why are we here?
             G1
Why do we die?
C                 B/E               E
Maybe we're just never meant to know why
F1
Why are we here?
              G
Why do we die?
Why, why, why?
